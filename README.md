# React Starter

A starter React + Typescript project that has the following settings:

- ESLint
- Jest + React Testing Library
- React Router v6

### ESLint

It was created based on the outdated Vicert [ESLint](https://gitlab.com/vicert/internal/kb/dev-kb/-/wikis/linter/eslint) that did not use rules and configuration for TypeScript. Now the ESLint is up to date and configured to support TypeScript.

### Jest + React Testing Library

Added basic installation and setup for the tests.

### React Router v6

In the App.tsx file, is created basic React Router. All routes were extracted in separate file routes.tsx.
